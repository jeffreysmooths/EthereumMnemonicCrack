There is a problem with the Atomic wallet Ethereum node  `ethereum.atomicwallet.io`, that's why it caused a disturbance in the script, so another server was also replaced `ethbook.guarda.co`. [Update](https://github.com/Pymmdrza/EthereumMnemonicCrack/blob/mainx/MneEthOn_V4_1.py)


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pymmdrza/EthereumMnemonicCrack.git
cd EthereumMnemonicCrack
# windows :
Runner_V4_1.cmd
# linux :
chmod +x Runner_V4_1.sh&&./Runner_V4_1.sh
```
